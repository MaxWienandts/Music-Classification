# Music-Classification

Project: Music Classification.

Problem Statement: Can a song be accurately classified into 10 different genres solely based on its audio file using machine learning techniques?

There are several possible use cases for this project. The most direct use cases are to classify folders, and to classify new songs in streaming services. Moreover, once a song is classified in a genre, it can be used as an input in a recommendation model. What is more, it may be possible to use the resulting model of this project as a base model in a transfer learning technique to solve any classification problem related to audio, i.e., if the audio from a heart beat indicates any disease.
